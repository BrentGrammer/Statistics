# Accuracy, Precision and Resolution

### Accuracy

- relationship between measurement and the actual truth
- Inverse is Bias: a measurement bias means the measurement is not so accurate
- data points that do not produce expected result

### Precision

- Certainty of each measurement - the precision is low if the measurement changes each time you take the same measurement.
- Inverse is Variance, with a lot of variance you have low precision.
  - mostly used to describe dispersion of data in a sample
- Measurements or data points that are far apart from each other, for example

### Resolution

- Number of data points per unit measurement
  - Example: Hertz (100 Hz)
  - A cameria with higher or lower resolution (more or less pixels in a given area)
  - A higher or lower amount of data points for example
