# Descriptive Statistics vs. Inferential Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics

- Describes the characteristics of a dataset
  - Mean, median, mode
  - Variance
  - Kurtosis, skew
  - Distribution shape
  - Spectrum
- No relation from the sample to the population; no generalization to other datasets or groups
- No comparison of the characteristics of one dataset to the characteristics of another dataset
- The main point is to have a few characteristics that describe the features of a particular set of data, i.e. just to characterize a dataset.

## Inferential Statistics

- Using features of a dataset to make claims about the population from which it was drawn
  - P-value
  - T/F/chi-square values
  - Confidence intervals
  - Hypothesis testing
- Purpose is to relate data features to populations or generalize to other datasets/groups
- Comparing values between datasets/groups to generalize results from a sample to a population.
